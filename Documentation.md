### **Documentation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model for QA Bot**

#### **1. Model Architecture**

**Overview:**
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for the QA bot is designed to handle questions related to a provided document or dataset by combining retrieval-based and generation-based approaches.

**Components:**

- **Document Storage and Retrieval:**
  - **Vector Database:** Pinecone DB is used for storing and retrieving document embeddings. It facilitates efficient vector search and similarity comparisons.
  - **Embedding Generation:** Cohere API is used to generate embeddings for both the document sections and user queries.

- **Generative Model:**
  - **Model Used:** Cohere API's generative model is used to create coherent answers based on the context retrieved from the vector database.

**Pipeline:**
1. **Text Extraction:** The PDF or document text is extracted using libraries like `PyPDF2`.
2. **Embedding Generation:** The extracted text is split into manageable sections. Each section is embedded using Cohere.
3. **Storing Embeddings:** The generated embeddings and text metadata are stored in Pinecone DB.
4. **Query Processing:** User queries are converted into embeddings and used to retrieve relevant document sections from Pinecone DB.
5. **Answer Generation:** The retrieved context is fed into the generative model to produce a response.

#### **2. Approach to Retrieval**

**Data Preparation:**
- **Text Extraction:** Documents are loaded and converted into text format.
- **Text Splitting:** The document text is split into sections (e.g., 150 words each) to create manageable chunks for embedding.

**Embedding and Storage:**
- **Embedding Generation:** Each text section is embedded using Cohere API.
- **Indexing:** The embeddings, along with metadata (section text), are stored in Pinecone DB.

**Query Processing:**
- **Query Embedding:** User queries are converted into embeddings.
- **Document Retrieval:** The query embedding is used to search for the most relevant document sections in Pinecone DB.

**Retrieval Algorithm:**
- **Top-k Search:** The closest matching document sections are retrieved based on cosine similarity of embeddings.
- **Metadata Inclusion:** Along with vector values, metadata (text of the section) is also included in the retrieval response.

#### **3. Generative Responses**

**Contextual Answer Generation:**
- **Context Compilation:** Relevant sections of the document are combined to form the context for answering the query.
- **Generation:** The context is used as input for the generative model (Cohere API) to create a coherent answer to the query.

**Examples and Outputs:**
- **Queries:** Example queries and their corresponding answers are demonstrated in the provided videos.
- **Videos:** Refer to the videos added in the repository for live demonstrations of the QA bot in action.

#### **4. Example Queries and Outputs**

- **Query 1:** "What is the main topic of the document?"
  - **Output:** [Generated Answer based on the document content]

- **Query 2:** "How to use Docker in the given context?"
  - **Output:** [Generated Answer based on Docker-related sections of the document]

**Notes:**
- For a complete demonstration, refer to the videos included in the GitHub repository that showcase various queries and the QA bot's responses.
